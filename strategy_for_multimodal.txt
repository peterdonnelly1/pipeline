Realisation
===========
- Don't have to use only matched data when coming up with the two opimized models that will be used to generate the embedding set
- If we save the embeddings back to the case directories, generate() will be able to be used with small numnber of mods, as the embeddings will be analagous to and in the same location as tile and rna inputs for the single mode case

Strategy
========

1  Change the Bash scripts to used keyword arguments rather than positional arguments                                                                                               <<< completed 19/10/20
      preparatory, really just to make flag handling easier. should have done this before now TBH

2  Perform single mode training, to generate an optimised model for each of image and rna data modes                                                                                <<< completed 19/10/20

     ./do_all stad image 
     ./do_all stad rna
   
    - but change generate() to create distinct model files for each mode: model_image.pt and model_rna.pt
    - test this change thoroughly before doing any further multi-modal enhancements
    
    inputs:  tiles and rna-seq data
    outputs: two optimised models

3 Used the optimised models to generate matched image+rna embeddings   <<< two functionality extensions
   
     ./just_test -d stad -i image -m image_rna
     ./just_test -d stad -i rna   -m image_rna
     
     - test mode only
     - repurpose the 'image_rna' flag so that it becomes a trigger to:                                                                                                              <<< completed 24/10/20 (images)
               (i)  only used matched cases and                                                                                                                                    
               (ii) extract and save FC1 embeddings BACK INTO THE CASE DIRECTORIES that the inputs came from
        - during generation(), only used matched cases (perform a spreadsheet lookup and 'skip' if not matched)                                                                     <<< completed 19/10/20
        - insert code into VGG11 to save FC1 image embedding back to the corresponding case directory (saved in fnames)                                                             <<< completed 24/10/20
             - VGGNN to return FC1 embedding (batch) as well as y2_hat                                                                                                              
               - but only during test mode, (using the last model saved during training)
               - this is a variation on the way we currently use test_mode, where we use it to push an entire patch through the optimum model
               - each embedding is the equivalent of a tile, so we will end up with as many embeddings in a case directory as there were tiles chosen from that same directory
               - we need (and have) the 'fnames', because they tell us where (which case directory) to save each embedding to ( <<<<< this also applies to rna-seq )
               - OTOH, can't use the fname to name the embeddings, since these are only unique per sample, not per tile/embedding. And also, we don't retain the tile names during tile processing
               - therefore, use random integers to name the embedddings; plus a suffix '_image_embedding' to identify them as image embeddings
        - Same thing but for rna-seq:
               - Make and store a  softlink based on an integer reference to the case id for later use so that DENSE will later know where to save the rna-seq embeddings           <<< completed 18/11/20 (rna-seq)
               - insert code into DENSE to save FC1 rna embedding back to the corresponding case directory (saved in fnames)
        - in the first instance, use ALL matched cases, LATER allow user to specify a particular number of cases
        - in the first instance, just select one of the FC layer outputs to save for embeddings, LATER allow user to specify the layer to use via an environment variable
        

    inputs:  the two optimised models saved at step 2
    outputs: embeddings for each of image and rna-seq, saved in the applicable case directories

 
4 Perform dual-mode training using the matched image+rna embeddings  << one trivial change, one non-trivial change

     ./just_run -d stad -m image_rna
     
      -  we need to generate, but not tile. ./do_all stad image_rna should delete all existing embedding sets ./only_run.sh should skip generation and assume the multimode .pt file already exists
      -  use the same flag to indicate that embeddings should be used as inputs rather than tiles or rna  << one trivial change, one non-trivial change
      -  create the concatenated embedding maps in generate(). Do this within the existing image generation code, by making a call to the rna generation code
      -  it will be easy to locate the matched files, since they are now all in the same directory (the case directory)
      -  the pt file will need just 'new_image_rna', 'new_label', and 'new_fname'
      -  save the optimised model as model_image_rna.pt
      
    inputs:  the embeddings for each of image and rna-seq, saved in the applicable case directories (i.e. the output of step 3)
    outputs: optimised multimodal model, ' model_image_rna.pt'

      
5 Perform dual-mode testing using the optimised model                << one trivial change

     ./just_test stad image_rna
     
     - make sure to avoid flag confusion with step 3 above
     - push some or all held-out multimode embeddings through the optimised model
     
    inputs:  optimised multimodal model, ' model_image_rna.pt'
    outputs: classifications
