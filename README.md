I greatefully acknowledge the following, who developed software that is used by CLASSI:

The core learning engine of ‘CLASSI’ buids on Gregory Gundersen’s ‘dpcca'  
**An attractive feature of this software is that it permits neural network models to be dynamically selected at run-time**  
Code: https://github.com/gwgundersen/dpcca  
Paper: "End-to-end Training of Deep Probabilistic CCA on Paired Biomedical Observations"
