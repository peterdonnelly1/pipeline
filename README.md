I greatefully acknowledge the efforts of the following for developing software used by CLASSI

The core learning engine of ‘CLASSI’ buids on Gundersen’s ‘dpcca'. An attractive feature of this software is the way it allows for neural network models to be dynamically selected at run-time; thus permitting models to be user configurable features.
